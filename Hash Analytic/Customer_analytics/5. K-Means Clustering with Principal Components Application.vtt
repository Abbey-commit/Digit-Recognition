00:00.940 --> 00:06.970
In this lecture we'll segment our data using k means clustering using principal components as features

00:07.550 --> 00:09.580
lets reuse the code we wrote before

00:16.420 --> 00:20.890
only this time as an argument we'll use these scores of the PCI.

00:20.890 --> 00:24.610
Note that the component scores are standardized by definition.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.560
That's why their values are so arbitrary.

00:27.580 --> 00:34.440
This is actually great news for us as there is no need to standardize them to make our code more semantic.

00:34.450 --> 00:42.730
Let's start by adding a PCI suffix to the K Means variable at all necessary places.

00:42.740 --> 00:45.060
Simple as that.

00:45.080 --> 00:50.320
Now let's visualize the within clusters sum of squares by number of clusters.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.250
We could employ the same code as before

00:56.440 --> 01:02.270
we'll just change the title of the graph to avoid any confusion.

01:02.380 --> 01:03.940
Great.

01:03.940 --> 01:08.340
Now it's time to pick the number of clusters through the Elbow Method.

01:08.380 --> 01:11.310
The result is very similar to what we got last time.

01:11.320 --> 01:16.620
However if you examine the two plots more closely you will see some differences.

01:16.630 --> 01:19.630
In any case the decision we make doesn't change.

01:19.630 --> 01:24.430
It still looks like the most prominent kink comes at the fore cluster mark once more.

01:24.430 --> 01:26.320
Well the jury is out.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.970
We'll be working with 4 clusters

01:31.220 --> 01:35.360
let's create a k means P.S. a model with 4 clusters.

01:35.540 --> 01:38.770
We'll use the same initialize her in random state as before.

01:39.910 --> 01:44.250
Next will fit the model with the principal component scores.

01:44.410 --> 01:45.160
Great.

01:45.220 --> 01:52.810
We've obtained the K Means PCI clustering solution with 4 clusters all right in the next video we'll

01:52.810 --> 01:56.460
exploit the results of our segmentation model in more detail.

01:56.470 --> 01:57.480
Thanks for watching.
